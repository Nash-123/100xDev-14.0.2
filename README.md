# Components can be made async in Next.js but not in React
# But that too in server side rendering not Client side 

# Next JS helps us create Backend Routes just like Express Does

# THis is a opinionated framework like use api folder for backend code n all


# Next runs mostly as a http server and will return you json and html


# if loader is there then Crawler will know using static site generation 
in Firebase  -> Firestore we will stop the visibility to false then also the 100x dev page shows, thats because of this feature static site generation
# Prisma is same as Node.js
